                    <h2>Description of Service</h2>
                    <p>SecureShot is a privacy-focused mobile application that enables users to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encrypt photos, videos, notes, and files locally on their device</li>
                        <li>Store encrypted files in secure cloud storage</li>
                        <li>Decrypt and view their files using passwords they create</li>
                        <li>Manage and organize encrypted content</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The App uses a <strong>zero-knowledge architecture</strong>, meaning we cannot access, view, or decrypt your encrypted files.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Account Security</h3>
                    <p>You are responsible for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials</li>
                        <li>All activities that occur under your account</li>
                        <li>Creating strong, unique passwords for your encrypted files</li>
                        <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized access</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Password Management</h3>
                    <p><strong>CRITICAL:</strong> You are solely responsible for remembering your file encryption passwords. Due to our zero-knowledge design:</p>

                        <li>Lost passwords mean permanent loss of access to your encrypted files</li>
                    </ul>
